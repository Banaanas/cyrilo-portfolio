1 - Flashing Dark Mode
There is still a short flash between colors modes on page load, when the User
has already chosen one before or its Browser is set to prefer-color-scheme: dark.
It's due to Next.js rendering the HTML before the JavaScript (and Emotion Theme(s)).
It could have been resolved with the help of CSS Variables used in our Global Css Sheet and
a Script added in the Document file, with or without a Library.

But because the Application toggles, not only between light and dark mode, but between
multiple Colors Themes, it has been decided not to inject this script
nor use CSS variables for now.


2 - When Use with an <a> styled by Emotion, the Next.js Link Component
does not pass the href, and Tab Key Navigation, among others, becomes impossible.
A Work-Around is to used the passHref prop inside the Link.

3 - When Open, the Burger Menu / Side Menu (NavBar Component) cover 100 %
of the Viewport because it has an "min-weight: 100vh" property.
It was not possible to put "min-weight: 100vh" because in this case, the
Header just take a -100% TranslateY when scroll down.

100vh would normally cause some bug with mobile browsers.

But here, because Scroll is disabled when the Burger Menu is open, the Bug
can NOT be visible (because Scroll is impossible).

4 - scroll-behavior: smooth; (body)
Because some Browsers still don't support CSS "scroll-behavior: smooth", React-Scroll
Library has also been used.
