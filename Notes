The Default Theme is required for the pre-rendered HTML and styles

- When Use with an <a> styled by Emotion, the Next.js Link Component
does not pass the href, and Tab Key Navigation, among others, becomes impossible.
A Work-Around is to used the passHref prop inside the Link.

- When Open, the Burger Menu / Side Menu (NavBar Component) cover 100 %
of the Viewport because it has an "min-weight: 100vh" property.
It was not possible to put "min-weight: 100vh" because in this case, the
Header just take a -100% TranslateY when scroll down.

100vh would normally cause some bug with mobile browsers.

But here, because Scroll is disabled when the Burger Menu is open, the Bug
can NOT be visible (because Scroll is impossible).

- scroll-behavior: smooth; (body)
Because some Browsers still don't support CSS "scroll-behavior: smooth", React-Scroll
Library has also been used.
